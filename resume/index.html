<h3>DSGN (Design Services for the Good Natured) <a href="http://dsgn.io">*</a></h3>
<p><em>Website:</em> Hand-coded, W3C-validated HTML5 and clean presentation. Fully responsive!</p>

<h3>FRSH×BTS <a href="http://frsh.fm">*</a></h3>
<p>
<em>Website:</em> Hand-coded, W3C-validated HTML5 and clean presentation.<br/><br/>
<em>Identity:</em> Futuristic logo design that borrows upon the Heaven/Sky trigram, "Qián" where the letters, “F” and “B” are overlaid upon each other.

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>I am a huge fan of Japanese culture, anime, design, and music. When I am not perusing my newsfeed list, updating social networks, listening to/viewing podcasts, I am usually listening to new music, finding tutorials, and sketching new concepts.</p>
<p>There is never too much to learn!</p>
