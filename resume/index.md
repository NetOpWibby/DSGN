# Resumé

My focus is to learn as much as I can, preferably in a position that can challenge and excite my brain on a regular basis, if not daily. You can also [find me on LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/paulanthonywebb "My profile on LinkedIn. Whyyyyy do I need a LinkedIn?"), if you're into the sort of thing. I am currently available for small, remote projects.

### Leaf

*Front-End Web Developer:*
Brought on as supplemental help to the only front-end developer at the time. Assisted the team in getting Leaf to 1.0 and got a plaque. Still have it, somewhere. They no longer exist, I think they were bought out.

*Timeframe:*
August 2012 — November 2012



### [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com "thoughtbot website")

*Design Apprentice:*
Thankfully, I wasn't required to fetch coffee for people. Shadowed the then co-owner of thoughtbot, then shadowed another great designer.

*Timeframe:*
January 2012 — April 2012



### Converse (Newbury Street location)

## Skills

### Front-End Web Design and Development

HTML5 and CSS3/Sass, wire-framing, responsive-first design, working knowledge of vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, and several JavaScript frameworks. Why are there so many?

I've also been getting ~~into NW.js (node-webkit)~~ electron. It has allowed me to get some of my crazy ideas off the ground.

### Adobe Photoshop

Simply put, I know how to design a website in Photoshop and code it afterwards. Nowadays, I tend to just sketch a wireframe on my iPad Pro and  Pencil with Procreate. Affinity Photo may replace Photoshop for me at some point, but Adobe's been fighting back recently.

## Education

### The Internet

I am being serious here.

I *did* go to college for Software Engineering, but a series of ~~un~~fortunate events ~~forced~~ enabled me to leave so I taught myself design and code. Thank *goodness* the Internet exists. I definitely owe [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee "The immaculate Sir Tim Berners-Lee, on Wikipedia") tuition.

*Timeframe:*
April 2007 — Present

### Interests

These days, I am all about the "Internet of Things" and getting my operating system and browser more developed. When I'm not boring my girlfriend with that, I'm playing Splatoon, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Super Smash Bros, listening to or creating new music, and trying to get any of my several business ideas off the ground.

I think too much. I probably want to do too much as well. That said, there is never too much to learn!
