<h2 class="title">Colophon</h2>

My focus is to learn as much as I can, preferably in a position that can challenge and excite my brain on a regular basis, if not daily.

<h2 class="title">Experience</h2>

### DockYard [*](http://dockyard.com)

*UX Developer:*
Assisted designers and Ember developers in building the front-end to single page Ember.js apps. Learned how to use Vim and got introduced to BEM syntax/methodologies. Really proud of the last project I worked on, but not sure about NDA-esque stuff at the moment.

*Timeframe:*
April 2014 — February 2015



### Gapelia [*](http://gapelia.com)

*Master of All:*
Built the entire front-end of the app, as well as the content creator. Gapelia was to be a cross between Medium and Facebook, for professors. Gapelia was later named Folio.

*Timeframe:*
May 2013 — April 2014



### Leaf [*](http://leaf.me)

*Front-End Web Developer:*
Brought on as supplemental help to the only front-end developer at the time. Assisted the team in getting Leaf to 1.0 and got a plaque. Still have it, somewhere.

*Timeframe:*
August 2012 — November 2012



### thougtbot [*](http://thoughtbot.com)

*Design Apprentice:*
Thankfully, I wasn't required to fetch coffee for people. Shadowed the then co-owner of thoughtbot, then shadowed another great designer. Had minor roles in several projects, but got to provide input (some valuable). Got introduced to Sass, GitHub, software development, and gained several experience points.

*Timeframe:*
January 2012 — April 2012



### Converse

*Maestro:*
Used Photoshop and a giant Brother printer to customize Chucks, hoodies, bags, books, t-shirts, &c. Cool stuff.

*Timeframe:*
November 2010 — January 2014



### DSGN [*](http://dsgn.io)

*Personal + Freelance:*
A plethora of self-initiated projects, both completed and on-going. Had client work, nothing to write home about.

<h2 class="title">Skills</h2>

### Front-End Web Design and Development

HTML5 and CSS3/Sass, wire-framing, responsive-first design, working knowledge of vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, and several JavaScript frameworks. Why are there so many?

I've also been getting into NW.js (node-webkit). It has allowed me to get some of my crazy ideas off the ground.

### Adobe Photoshop

Simply put, I know how to design a website in Photoshop and code it afterwards. Nowadays, I tend to just sketch a wireframe with pen/cil and paper. Affinity Designer may replace Photoshop for me soon though.

<h2 class="title">Education</h2>

### The Internet

I am being serious here.

I *did* go to college for Software Engineering, but a series of unfortunate events forced me to leave so I taught myself design and code. Thank goodness the Internet exists.

April 2007 — Present

### Interests

These days, I am all about the "Internet of Things" and getting my operating system and browser more developed. When I'm not boring my girlfriend with that, I'm playing Super Smash Bros (or an RPG), listening to or creating new music, and trying to get any of my several venture ideas off the ground.

I think too much. I probably want to do too much as well. That said, there is never too much to learn!
