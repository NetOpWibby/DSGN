						<p>I am a proud lefty, Aries, and space bandit. The only pencil I trust is a Ticonderoga. I was born on Easter Sunday, 1988. I used to be an &ldquo;Army-brat&rdquo;. My parents despised video games while I was growing up, so I am making up for it now. I make music under various aliases, the most used being &ldquo;the Wibby&rdquo; (followed by FRSH&times;BTS and Spaceman Fresh).</p>

						<p>I named my portfolio &ldquo;Design Services for the Good Natured&rdquo; because no one likes a jerk. Every day brings about new opportunities, inspiration, and kick-ass &ldquo;whoah&rdquo; moments. Spread the love and do your part by inspiring others as you’ve been inspired! <strong>(:</strong> That’s what I try to do anyway.</p>

							<p>I was inspired by a print piece for this. The problem? The piece had triangles on paper. That was okay, but I wanted triangles in space. BOOM.</p>

							<p>There are four versions of this wallpaper with different glow colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. I am quite partial to the black and magenta flavors.</p>
