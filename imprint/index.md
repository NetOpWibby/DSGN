# Imprint

## Website

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll — Static blogging engine") and hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=fd45d6b57e0f "DigitalOcean — Secure servers at a great price (affiliate link)"). There's no responsive framework here, I do that by eye. Posts are written in Markdown, [RDiscount-flavored](http://dafoster.net/projects/rdiscount "Classic Markdown renderer for Jekyll"), using [Brackets](http://brackets.io "My favorite text/code editor"). I buy my domain names from [Hover](https://hover.com/gabSji1r "Hover — Best registrar I've dealt with thus far (affiliate link)") too, they're pretty great. The typefaces used are [Karla](http://brick.im/fonts/karla "Karla page on Brick"), [Noto Serif](http://brick.im/fonts/notoserif "Noto Serif page on Brick"), and [Fira Mono](http://brick.im/fonts/firamono "Fira Mono page on Brick"). [Brick](http://brick.im "Super dope font CDN") has a CDN for that.

I used to deploy DSGN via [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit "THE best SFTP app I've ever used") like a *savage*, but now I use [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com "Remote server automation tool, written in Ruby") (I really [should update](/thoughts/post/jekyll-deployment-with-digitalocean "My "Jekyll deployment with DigitalOcean" post") to version 3 at some point). The source code for this site is [on GitHub](https://github.com/NetOperatorWibby/DSGN "DSGN source code, on GitHub").
