This clock is based upon a screensaver developed by a Japanese company, [Amana](http://amana.jp). There are people who created versions of this clock for Mac, but there was nothing available for Windows... **:(**

SO I MADE ONE. BOOYUHKA!

Note: you will require [Rainmeter](htp://rainmeter.net/cms) and a Windows OS to use this.
