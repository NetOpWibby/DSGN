I was inspired by a print piece for this. The problem? The piece had triangles on paper. That was okay, but I wanted triangles in space. BOOM.

There are four versions of this wallpaper with different glow colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. I am quite partial to the black and magenta flavors.
