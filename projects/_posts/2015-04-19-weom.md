The idea for this project, WEÖM, has been in my head for quite some time, and it is finally out. Pronounced *wee-oohm*, it stands for, "Wisdom Escapes Ordinary Minds". That is to say, we as a people have stopped asking questions and have stopped wondering (I am speaking of outer space and other futuristic things, specifically). Of course, there are people like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Elon Musk trying to educate the world about the many things that can be possible, but the average person just doesn't care.

This saddened me a lot. Learning I couldn't donate money to NASA due to certain protections put in place at its inception pissed me off. With these conflicting feelings, I felt that I could at least do something to get people interested in space, if not start talking about it.

WEÖM is the beginning of a *much* larger plan, and this post will updated as those projects get released. For now, [visit the official site](https://xn--wem-tna.com)!
