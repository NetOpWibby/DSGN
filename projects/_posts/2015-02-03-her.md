I created this abstract as a celebration of women, in a way. Now that I think about it, those moons probably have significance now...after all, another name for "moon" is "Luna".

Fun fact: I had a crush on a girl in elementary school with that name.

I couldn't decide on a handful of wallpaper styles, so there are **14** to choose from. **:3**
