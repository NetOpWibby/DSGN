Initially, Aries wasn't supposed to even exist. I was coding hikari and realized I should've started with a smaller project, haha! So, a web browser was a good start!

Aries was first built upon [node-webkit](http://nwjs.io "NW.js official site"), and it was good (node-webkit version is [here](https://github.com/IdeasNeverCease/Aries/tree/v1 "node-webkit version of Aries")). One day, I decided to create an [Electron](http://electron.atom.io "Electron official site")-based fork of Aries (based upon all the great things I was hearing about it) and found I was able to recreate the same functionality in half the code and minus a bunch of hacks (but, let's be real — half of **all** code is hacked, amirite?).

In Aries, you can:

* create new tabs
* close tabs
* search from the address bar (default search is [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com "Super awesome search engine"), and I don't intend to change that)
* use it to take screenshots of whatever website you're working on, in a browser with dope chrome

Here's a bigger preview of Aries, in action:

The choice to name my browser was pretty easy — Aries is my zodiac sign. And, seeing as how the official animal of Aries is the ram, I thought it would be pretty funny if someone said, "Aries *rams* the competition", haha! *Ahem*. No? Hmm, welp...

You can find [Aries on GitHub](https://github.com/IdeasNeverCease/Aries "Aries sourcecode, on GitHub"). Download it, fork it, inspect the code, have fun! I haven't created any releases, or, downloadable executables yet because I don't feel like it's ready for 1.0. Close! But, no quite. There's plenty of features I plan to add, so stay tuned!
