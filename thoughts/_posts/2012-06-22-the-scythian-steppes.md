Sword and Sworcery is a super-awesome game (that got its start on the iPad and is now available on Mac/PC). The soundtrack? Even better. The Scythian Steppes: Seven #Sworcery Songs Localized for Japan is a collection of songs from the original soundtrack remixed for the launch of the Japanese localization of the game.

Jim Guthrie, the man behind the oh-so-beautiful sounds released this album on his Bandcamp page yesterday. Have a listen!
