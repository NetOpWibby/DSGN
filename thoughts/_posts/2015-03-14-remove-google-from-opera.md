I just wanted to share a quick tip that I stumbled across today.

When Opera initially diverged from Presto to work on Blink with Google, they gave significant screen real estate to Google's Search Bar on their Start Page. I hated it because 1, I use DuckDuckGo and 2, Opera also didn't allow for setting a custom search engine as default (they do now though, even though you can't delete the included default engines).

Anyhoo, simply get to the Preferences screen in Opera and input the Konami code (just leave out the `START`). For those that don't know the code, it is `up`, `up`, `down`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `left`, `right`, `b`, `a`. You'll be presented with this screen:

Now, you can go from this:

  <figcaption>Yuck, WTF</figcaption>
</figure>



To this:

  <figcaption>Ahhhhh, much better</figcaption>
</figure>



The little search icon in the top right is there to filter through websites you have saved in your Speed Dial.
