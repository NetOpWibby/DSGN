The Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program is Nintendo's way of showing appreciation for consumers who purchased a Nintendo 3DS hand-held system during its first few months of availability.

Basically, "Thank you for spending $250 on a handheld, even though we're going to knock down the price by 80 bucks in a few months". I, of course, was one of the early adopters (I attended a midnight launch).

Only five of the ten NES Virtual Console games have been announced so far. They are as follows:

* Super Mario Bros.
* Donkey Kong Jr.
* Balloon Fight
* Ice Climber
* The Legend of Zelda

Only five of the ten GBA Virtual Console games have been announced so far. They are as follows:

* Yoshiâ€™s Island: Super Mario Advance 3
* Mario Kart: Super Circuit
* Metroid Fusion
* WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$
* Mario vs. Donkey Kong

On top of all this, all of the great 3DS games will be coming out in the latter half of this year too. Woop woop! **=D**
