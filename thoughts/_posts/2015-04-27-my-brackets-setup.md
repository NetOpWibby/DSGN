As a longtime [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org) user in my PC days, I have found [Brackets](http://brackets.io) to be a suitable replacement for editing and viewing code...I would even call it an upgrade. I was screensharing with a remote co-worker today and he kept asking me what I use for several plugins, so I thought I would whip up a quick blog post to share with everyone.

You can search for these plugins (and install!) within Brackets itself by bringing up the Extension Manager and copy/pasting the titles below.

### Autosave Files on Window Blur[*](https://github.com/martypenner/brackets-autosave-files-on-window-blur)
* Autosave all open files when switching applications, in the style of PHPStorm/WebStorm.

I still hit `Cmd + S` (sometimes) even though I don't need to. You're going to look at your browser right after you edit code anyway, so why waste (a) precious second(s) tapping keys?



### Beautify[*](https://github.com/drewhamlett/brackets-beautify)
* Format JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.



### Brackets CSS Color Preview[*](https://github.com/cmgddd/Brackets-css-color-preview)
* Preview the colors within CSS files.



### Brackets File Tree
* Visual display of the tree of files and folders.



### Brackets Sass[*](https://github.com/jasonsanjose/brackets-sass)
* Compiles Sass (sass/scss) files when changed. Updates styles during Live Preview. Experimental support for Quick Edit.

**NOTE:** [Joshua Miller](https://twitter.com/Josh_AM) informed me of this plugin and I must say, it's a hell of a lot better than trying to remember Terminal commands. Getting this setup was a little tricky, so I'll make a post detailing the process later.



### Code Folding[*](https://github.com/thehogfather/brackets-code-folding)
* Brackets extension that provides simple code folding for files edited in brackets. Supports brace folding, tag folding, indent folding and multi-line comment folding.

As of release 1.3 (Brackets notified me of an update as I began writing this post), code folding is integrated by default. Sweet! This plugin will continue to exist for Bracket versions below 1.3.



### Dracula[*](https://github.com/NetOperatorWibby/DraculaBrackets)
* Improved Dracula theme.

This one is by your's truly! I love the Dracula theme, but the [original Brackets theme](https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets) I was using wasn't 100% to my liking, so I fixed some things and optimized a lot of other things.



### Indent Guides[*](https://github.com/lkcampbell/brackets-indent-guides)
* Show indent guides in the code editor.

I modify this in my preferences file to show as dotted lines. Just looks cleaner IMO, than the default solid line.



### Indentator[*](https://github.com/ahuth/brackets-indentator)
* Re-indent a document using your current indentation settings.



### Interactive Linter[*](https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/Brackets-InteractiveLinter)
* Interactive linting for Brackets.

I use [JSHint](http://jshint.com) usually, but when I remember I have this plugin, I use this!



### Open .gitignore[*](https://github.com/danielmahon/brackets-opengitignore)
* This extension will try to find and open the .gitignore file which Brackets hides by default.

For those times when you need to ignore files and folders, but can't be bothered to show hidden files in the filesystem.



### Paste and Indent[*](https://github.com/ahuth/brackets-paste-and-indent)
* Automatically apply the correct indentation to pasted text.



### Right Click Extended[*](https://github.com/jbardnz/RightClickExtended)
* Adds Cut, Copy, and Paste options to the right click menu - now with multi-language support.

I really don't understand why this isn't in Brackets by default.



### SVG Preview[*](https://github.com/peterflynn/svg-preview)
* Live preview SVG files in an inline panel while you edit them. Click in SVG to jump to corresponding code.

I find this plugin incredibly helpful, especially as I start using SVGs more. You can optimize by hand and see if you mess something up.



### Tabs - Custom Working[*](https://github.com/DH3ALEJANDRO/custom-work-for-brackets)
* Adds toolbar it include buttons show/hide with tabs of active documents on the top of the editor.



### Trailingspaces[*](https://github.com/scientech-com-ua/brackets-trailingspaces)
* Extension which visualizes trailing whitespaces.

I fucking hate trailing spaces. They look terrible! Stop leaving that crap in your code.



### Unused Files[*](https://github.com/Dammmien/brackets-unused-files)
* Find unused files in your web project.

When I refactor components and optimize code in my browser and OS projects, I tend to leave behind files that are now wasting space. This plugin will help you streamline resources.

And there you have it! I will keep this post updated as I change my setup. Here's a screenshot of it, where you can see some of the plugins mentioned, in action:
