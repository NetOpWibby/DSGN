I find Anna Wintour to be a fascinating person, and I admire her work and fashion sensibilities. I stumbled upon this "73 Questions" section of Vogue's site, and they have a lot of them. The point of these videos is that the interviewee has to answer rapid-fire questions from the interviewer/videographer. Very interesting, to say the least.
