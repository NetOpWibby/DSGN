Anyone who doesn't like Helvetica is a friend in my eyes, so by that logic, Erik and I go way back. Kidding aside, the amount of passion Erik has for type is amazing. I mean, most people don't have that kind of passion about anything so to see someone living and breathing their passion is refreshing. I try to do the same in my work so I look at people like him for inspiration, tips, &c.

Another thing I like about Erik is how straightforward he is. I feel that straightforwardness is often mistaken for rudeness, because most people do not like to hear the truth about themselves or things they like. He recently did an interview with [FvF](http://www.freundevonfreunden.com/interviews/erik-spiekermann) and there were two quotes I really liked.

Unintentionally, I have started to apply this quote to my life, just a few years ago. When I came across it earlier this week, I laughed because of the timeliness of it.

My professional life has led me to encounter several assholes of various levels. To be honest, I became one myself but [learned the error of my ways](/thoughts/post/the-importance-of-process). Unfortunately, not everyone does and that will only hurt business in the long-run. My journey has led me to an asshole-free zone/workplace (haha!), though I am **sure** I will encounter variations as I enter other fields.



> Judge people for what they can do, not what they have done. Really look after your friends and your colleagues. You always meet again, if you treat someone badly now, he or she, at some point, is going to come back to you.

Basically, live by the [Golden Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). Treat others as you'd like to be treated. Since 5<sup>th</sup> grade, I have tried to live this way and for the most part, it's worked. I try to keep in touch with the awesome people I've worked with in the past because they are **1**) great at what they do **2**) super smart, and **3**) fantastic to be around.

You never know how someone can help you, or even better, how you can help *them*. Aside from your own ideas and ideals, the most **important** thing in the world is relationships.
