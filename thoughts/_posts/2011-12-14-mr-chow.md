I have heard many a famous person reference Mr. Chow, but I did not know anything about him, other than he operates in the restaurant business. After watching this video, I can understand the appeal of the man. I feel like all the Chinese food I have eaten (thus far) in my life is probably shit compared to everything he and his team makes.

I have got to meet him one day. He sounds like he an interesting guy to converse with. Oh, and I want his recipes.

### To marinate chicken

3. Heat the wok with one teaspoon of vegetable oil until medium hot and add bean sauce, sugar, chicken stock, and sesame seed oil.
4. Sauté until the sauce thickens.
