Welcome!

I already have a <a href="/me">page introducing myself</a>, so this post will assume you have an idea of who I am. Nice ta meetcha!

As any designer knows, designing for oneself can be a bitch. I am extremely picky and tend to be obsessive over details normal people would overlook. On the other hand, if I spent all my time trying to make things perfect, I would never release anything&hellip;so my site is up (you&rsquo;re looking at it)!

I am not sure how many times this site/portfolio has been redesigned, but I can say this is the first time it has become its own domain!

DSGN was hosted on a subdomain of my first-ever (and still actively used) domain name, <a href="http://pw-software.com">http://pw-software.com</a> (&ldquo;PW&rdquo; for my name, Paul Webb). I was competing with a company called &ldquo;P+W Software&rdquo; in Google&rsquo;s search ranking until <a href="http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/press-release/consumer-health-technologies-inc-acquires-pw-software">they were acquired</a> by a different company. I kinda felt bad but it gave me a few chuckles.

Anyhoo, once .io domains were available, I knew I had to purchase dsgn.io. Because of the high barrier to purchase (the .io TLD costs $99 to register), I knew the typical design blog with &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s ## brushes for free&rdquo;-like blog posts wouldn&rsquo;t take it (related: there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dsgn.io">Facebook page</a> who shares the name DSGN.IO. They post a lot of cool things, but hopefully none of their readers/followers will get confused).

DSGN runs on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static blogging engine. There are still some things not <em>super</em> optimized (like easily going to the next post, ugh), but expect things to get better soonish.

Enjoy your stay!

Fun Fact: My initial foray into graphic design was sometime in the fall of 2006, and web design followed soon after. If you are a longtime web developer/designer, you can remember a time when &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; was a thing and it was trendy to embellish your website with grungy textures (like coffee stains), and spelling things without vowels ¬Å&mdash; that&rsquo;s where &ldquo;DSGN&rdquo; came from.
