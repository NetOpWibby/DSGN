This game was built in 48 hours (as is required by the game-making marathon, "Ludum Dare").

I got stuck on a few parts, and died. That is where I ended my playtime (around 23 minutes&hellip;apparently, the game is beatable between 20 and 30 minutes). The only problem is, you have to start the game over when you die.

Prelude of the Chambered reminds me a lot of Wolfenstein, and is even creepier at times.

Java is required to play this game, as it is browser-based. What a marvelous time-waster. You'll look productive while playing this, I know I did.
