Being a web designer is also being your own worst client.

As soon as you get tired of how your website looks, you want to change it. In my case, I don&rsquo;t even want to write any new posts. However, it occurred to me that I have a *lot* of updates and ponderings that don&rsquo;t fit in a single tweet. Development on [hikari](https://github.com/IdeasNeverCease/hikari) has halted as I&rsquo;ve ramped up development on [Aries](https://github.com/IdeasNeverCease/Aries). What I learn with Aries will benefit hikari anyway, so I don't view that as a loss.

I have not updated the Projects section on here for quite some time because I do not like the process of doing so. Right now, this site is static, and built with Jekyll. It would be nice to have some sort of lightweight, custom CMS to use instead. [Maybe I&rsquo;ll build one](https://dribbble.com/shots/1268526--AltCMS)? Idk&hellip;

Regarding me being tired of this site&rsquo;s design, I have [started designing](https://dribbble.com/shots/1828440-ReDSGN) and coding the next iteration of DSGN. This time though, the redesign isn&rsquo;t just me becoming bored with the current style, it&rsquo;s just that my skills have improved tremendously since joining DockYard. My site, in its current state is not an accurate representation of what I can do. It is not difficult to put up a decent-looking site, and with everything I have at my disposal, I want to create something that delights me and keeps me excited about adding more content to it. Really, I just want to impress myself.

I really wish I had the code of my old sites so I could put up a time capsule of sorts, but HDD failures and the subsequent data loss ruined that for me. Then again, I learned the importance of backing up files. If you aren&rsquo;t using [Backblaze*](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01gavm) to back up your computer/external HDDs, you&rsquo;re crazy. Five bucks a month is less than what you pay for Netflix.

Anyhoo, to end my tangent, expect more posts and hopefully, regular updates.
