I find this extremely unfair.

> The Barbican marks the 50th anniversary of the James Bond franchise, from 1962's Dr No to this year's Skyfall, with a unique exhibition showcasing the inside story of the design and style of the world's most influential and iconic movie brand.

You know why this is unfair? [The exhibition](https://www.barbican.org.uk/bond) will only be shown in London, England. Even better, there will be a martini bar as well!

Bloody hell...at least I can enjoy these videos.
