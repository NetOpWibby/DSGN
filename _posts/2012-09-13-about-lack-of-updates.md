I am currently working at a tech startup in Cambridge, MA. I am also working on the redesign of my audio portfolio, "[FRSH&times;BTS](http://frsh.pw-software.com)" ([see WIPs here](http://dribbble.com/nokadota/projects/77987-FRSH-BTS)). I am finally getting some code underway for my "hikari OS" project ([placeholder site](http://hikari.pw-software.com)). I am working on creating tunes for my annual "Music from the Love Lounge" album (listen/download to the previous 3 â€” [1](http://frsh.pw-software.com/mftll1) / [2](http://frsh.pw-software.com/mftll2) / [3](http://frsh.pw-software.com/mftll3)). I am also the chief front-end designer of a super-secret start-up I am unable to talk about right now.

Annnnnd, I've come to the conclusion that I <del>hate</del> strongly dislike using WordPress. It comes with too much stuff and I feel like I should create my own CMS, so that's yet *another* project for me to work on.

Never fear though! I am very much active on sites like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NetOpWibby) and [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/nokadota).

Til next time!
