I am currently working at a tech startup in Cambridge, MA. I am also working on the redesign of my audio portfolio, "<a href="http://frsh.pw-software.com/">FRSH&times;BTS</a>" (<a href="http://dribbble.com/nokadota/projects/77987-FRSH-BTS">see WIPs here</a>). I am finally getting some code underway for my "hikari OS" project (<a href="http://hikari.pw-software.com/">placeholder site</a>). I am working on creating tunes for my annual "Music from the Love Lounge" album (listen/download to the previous 3 â€” <a href="http://frsh.pw-software.com/mftll1">1</a> / <a href="http://frsh.pw-software.com/mftll2">2</a> / <a href="http://frsh.pw-software.com/mftll3">3</a>). I am also the chief front-end designer of a super-secret start-up I am unable to talk about right now.

Annnnnd, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that I <del>hate</del> strongly dislike using WordPress. It comes with too much stuff and I feel like I should create my own CMS, so that&rsquo;s yet <em>another</em> project for me to work on.

Never fear though! I am very much active on sites like <a href="https://twitter.com/NetOpWibby">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://dribbble.com/nokadota">Dribbble</a>.

Til next time!
