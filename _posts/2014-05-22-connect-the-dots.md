<blockquote>
	You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something &mdash; your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.<br/><br/>
	&mdash; Steve Jobs

As I get older I am quicker to understand and build upon lessons and experiences from my past. I saw this quote yesterday and it really resonated with me.
