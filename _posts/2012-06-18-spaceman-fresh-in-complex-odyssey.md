This is the title for my next (major) project.

In addition to graphic design and web design/development, <a href="http://frsh.pw-software.com">I also create music</a>! I use monikers like FRSH×BTS, the Wibby, and of course, Spaceman Fresh. For the longest time, I had the idea of creating a universe in which Spaceman Fresh, my band WEÖM + the Space Bandits, and other interstellar ideas I may have in the future could reside.

I plan to have most (if not all) of the music videos I create be part of a large story arc. Where it ends, nobody knows! I feel that a lot of music nowadays is disposable...longevity/shelf life is ignored for favor of the 15 minutes of <strong>now</strong>. I find that depressing.

There are many goals for this project, but the most important one is that I learn how to use a 3D modeling program very well (Blender and/or Cinema 4D). I also want to get better with Adobe After Effects, and learn how to comp real-life footage with CGI (I am constructing an 18-inch miniature model starship).

There are many stages to this project, and I only have the beginning down pat. More (hopefully coherent) updates to come soon!
