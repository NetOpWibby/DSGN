# Me

Welcome to DSGN! My name is Paul Anthony Webb, and I am a Boston-based front-end web designer and developer. I like making awesome things (for awesome people).

I could not decide if I preferred graphic or web design more than the other, so I chose to do both. My last name is a lucky coincidence (or is it? ಠ_ಠ). For the sake of titles, you could say I am a front-end web developer *who just so happens* to be a graphic designer. That's called UX design these days.

Since 2008, I have coded and designed websites. Nowadays, I work on web apps, a browser, and an operating system (and a bunch of other crazy/interesting things).

The web industry is constantly changing and I love being at the forefront of new technologies. Take a look through my portfolio to see what I do with this awesomeness (my Projects page will be more fleshed out in Q1 2016). If you would like to work with me on your project, [drop me a line](mailto:paul@dsgn.io "Send me an email") (you can also check out [my resumé](/resume "Paul Anthony Webb's resumé")).

## Miscellaneous

<!--/ ad /-->

I am a proud lefty, Aries, and space bandit. The only pencil I trust is a Ticonderoga. I was born on Easter Sunday, 1988 (not religious, but it's an interesting anecdote). I used to be an "Army-brat". My parents despised video games while I was growing up, so I am making up for it now. I make music under various aliases, the most used being "the Wibby" (followed by FRSH&times;BTS and Spaceman Fresh).

I named my portfolio "Design Services for the Good Natured" because no one likes a jerk. Every day brings about new opportunities, inspiration, and kick-ass "whoah" moments. Spread the love and do your part by inspiring others as you’ve been inspired! (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ That’s what I try to do anyway.
