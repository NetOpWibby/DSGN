title: "About Paul Anthony Webb"
---

Welcome to DSGN! My name is Paul Anthony Webb, and I am a Boston-based front-end web designer and developer. I like making awesome things (for awesome people).

I could not decide if I preferred graphic or web design more than the other, so I chose to do both. My last name is a lucky coincidence. For the sake of titles, you could say I am a front-end web developer *who just so happens* to be a graphic designer. That's called UX design these days.

I was self-taught for almost 5 years before I received formal training in the form of an apprenticeship. It was then that I learned about [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) (goodbye regular CSS!), the importance of iteration, top-level design thinking, and so on.

The web industry is constantly changing and I love being at the forefront of new technologies. Take a look through my portfolio to see what I do with this awesomeness. If you would like to work with me on your project, [drop me a line](http://twitter.com/NetOpWibby) (you can also check out <a href="/resume" class="animsition-link" data-animsition-out="zoom-out-sm">my resume</a>).

<h2 class="title">Miscellaneous</h2>

I am a proud lefty, Aries, and space bandit. The only pencil I trust is a Ticonderoga. I was born on Easter Sunday, 1988. I used to be an "Army-brat". My parents despised video games while I was growing up, so I am making up for it now. I make music under various aliases, the most used being "the Wibby" (followed by FRSH&times;BTS and Spaceman Fresh).

I named my portfolio "Design Services for the Good Natured" because no one likes a jerk. Every day brings about new opportunities, inspiration, and kick-ass "whoah" moments. Spread the love and do your part by inspiring others as you’ve been inspired! **(:** That’s what I try to do anyway.

<h2 class="title">Website</h2>

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [DigitalOcean*](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=fd45d6b57e0f). I buy my domain names from [Hover*](https://hover.com/gabSji1r) too, they are pretty great. The fonts used are [Grota Sans](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/grota-sans), [Range Serif](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/range-serif), and [Texta](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/texta), all purchased from [MyFonts](http://www.myfonts.com).
